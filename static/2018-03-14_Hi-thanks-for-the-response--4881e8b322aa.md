Hi thanks for the response.

This is just for a demonstration. Actually we need to change state when something like Login Action take place in the system. This can be handled anywhere in your application. So i prefer to use vuex for that.

But as you mentioned it’'s completely fine to use this with **beforeEnter** in vue router.

Concept is using dynamic components to achieve the task, you can use it anywhere you want
